# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on<br>Mastering the art of turning coffee into code. Also diving deep into React.js, Next.js, and AI/ML models (because why not have it all?).<br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on<br>Anything that involves building innovative pet adoption systems, stock price prediction models, or solving world problems through tech.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking for help with<br>Getting my backend to match my frontend skills. Oh, and if you know any easier way to explain CSS to a 5-year-old, I’m all ears.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning<br>Full-stack web development and how to deploy AI models on cloud platforms (spoiler: it involves lots of coffee).<br><br>💬 Ask me about<br>Frontend development, AI/ML, React, or why debugging feels like a workout for the brain.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact<br>I can probably explain a stock market trend better than a pet adoption process (but I'm working on both!).
