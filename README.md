# üí´ About Me:
 I‚Äôm currently focused on <br>
Mastering the art of coding like a wizard‚Äîcasting spells with React.js, Next.js, and AI/ML, and seeing where this tech journey takes me!<br><br> I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on <br>
Any full-stack projects‚Äîespecially with someone who‚Äôs got the backend skills‚Äîto build innovative solutions and solve real-world problems through tech!<br><br> I‚Äôm looking for help with<br>Getting my backend to match my frontend skills. Oh, and if you know any easier way to explain CSS to a 5-year-old, I‚Äôm all ears.<br><br> I‚Äôm currently learning<br>Full-stack web development and how to deploy AI models on cloud platforms (spoiler: it involves lots of coffee).<br><br> Ask me about<br>Frontend development, AI/ML, React, or why debugging feels like a workout for the brain.<br><br>I can probably explain the lifecycle of a bug in code better than I can explain how to properly use z-index (still figuring that one out!).
