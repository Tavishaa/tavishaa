# 💫 About Me:  
Currently out here coding my way through life, making AI models smarter, web apps sleeker, and debugging sessions less soul-crushing (debatable). If it involves tech, innovation, and the occasional dramatic sigh at CSS, I’m all in.

I’m looking to collaborate on
Anything full-stack, AI-powered, or downright futuristic. Whether it’s a sleek web app, a smart automation tool, or an idea that makes people say, "Wait, you built THAT?"—I want in. Bonus points if it’s fun, challenging, or just an excuse to flex some skills.

I’m looking for help with
Getting my backend to stop embarrassing me. My frontend is out here serving aesthetics, while my backend is... well, let’s just say it’s still finding itself. Also, if you know the secret to writing CSS without questioning your life choices, let’s talk.

I’m currently learning
Full-stack development (React, Next.js, Node.js) while also wrangling AI models into cloud deployments like some kind of tech sorceress. Oh, and mastering the delicate balance of hackathons, coffee addiction, and actually getting sleep (spoiler: I’m failing at the last one).
